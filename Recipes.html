           <h3> Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
    <li>Basmati Rice</li>
    <li>1 medium-large sized onion</li>
    <li>Crushed 1 inch ginger</li>
    <li>2-3 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>1 green chilli</li>
            </ul>
    
            <hr>
    <h3>Saut'e Spices, Aromatics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 to 4 cloves</li>
        <li>3 to 4 green cardamoms</li>
        <li>1 inch cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 single strand of mace</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>
        Prep Work
    </h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li> Rinse 1 cup basmati rice or 200 grams basmati rice very well in water, till the water runs clear of the starch.</li>
        <br>
        <img src="soaking rice.webp" alt="Soaking Rice">
        <br>
        <br>
        Soak the rice in sufficient water for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, drain all the water and set the soaked rice aside.
        <br>
        <br>
        <li> When the rice is soaking, prep the vegetables by chopping them. Slice 1 medium to large onion thinly (1 cup thinly sliced onions). Crush 1 inch ginger, 2 to 3 garlic cloves and 1 green chili (about 1 teaspoon chopped green chillies) in a mortar-pestle.</li>
        <br>
    
        Fry the spices on low heat till they splutter and are fragrant.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="fryspices.webp" alt="Frying">
        <br>
        <br>
    
        <li> Now add the sliced onions and 5 to 6 curry leaves. If you do not have curry leaves, then add 1 medium sized tej patta (Indian bay leaf) when you fry the whole spices in step 3 above.
        </li>
        <br>
        <img src="sauteonions.webp" alt="Suating">
    
        <li>Stir and mix very well.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Sauté stirring often on low to medium-low heat till the onions turn light golden or are translucent.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Then add the crushed ginger-garlic-green chili paste. Stir and sauté for about 10 to 12 seconds or till the raw aroma of ginger and garlic goes away.</li>

        <img src="addcashews.webp" alt="Cashews">
        <li>Stir and mix again</li>
    
        <h2>Add Veggies, Rice, Coconut Milk</h2>
            <li>Now add the mixed vegetables. You can add ¾ to 1 cup of any mixed vegetables, either fresh or frozen. I added ½ cup green peas and ⅓ cup chopped french beans.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Stir and sauté the vegetables for a minute.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Then add the soaked basmati rice.</li>
            <br>
            <img src="addBasmati.webp" alt="Add Basmati">
            <br>
            <br>
    
            <li>Gently mix and stir the basmati rice with the rest of the ingredients.</li>
            <br>
            <img src="afterAddingBasmati.webp" alt="Stir">
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Now pour ¾ cup of thick coconut milk. You can also add 1 cup thick coconut milk. Here I have used canned coconut milk, but you can use first extract of homemade coconut milk.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Add 1 to 1.25 cups water. If using 1 cup of coconut milk, then add 0.75 to 1 cup water.
               </li>
               <br>
               Remember to add the correct amount of liquids depending on the quality and type of rice you are using. For 1 cup of basmati rice, you need to add about 1.75 to 2 cups of the liquids.
               <br>

               <br>
    
               <h2>Cook Coconut Milk Rice</h2>
               <li>. Stir well. Then season with salt as required. Taste the stock, it should feel slightly salty.</li>
               <br>
               Cover and pressure cook Coconut Milk Rice for 1 to 2 whistles or for 8 to 9 minutes on medium to medium-high heat. I pressure cooked for 2 whistles.
               <br>

               <br>
               <br>
    
               <li>When the pressure settles down naturally in the cooker, open the lid and gently fluff the rice.</li>
               <br>
    <img src="fluff rice.webp" alt="FluffRice">
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Garnish with some chopped coriander or mint leaves. Serve Coconut Milk Rice with salad, raita, pickle or a shorba gravy.

    <h1>North Indian</h1>
    
    <section id="NorthIndianSection">
        <h2><b><p>NAAN INGREDIENTS:</p></b></h2>
        <ul>
    <li>2 cup warm water (about 110°F)</li>
    <li>4 tablespoon honey</li> <img src="honeyy.jpeg.jpg">
    <li>2 (0.25 ounce) package active dry yeast (about 4 1/4 teaspoons)</li> <img src="active yeast.jpeg.jpg">
    <li>7 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
    <li>4 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li> <img src="2 eggs.jpeg.jpg">
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><p>(OPTIONAL) GARLIC BUTTER INGREDIENTS:</p></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup salted butter</li>
    <li>6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
    <li>finely- chopped fresh cilantro or parsley</li>
    <li>(optional) flaky sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    
        <br>
        <h2><p>INSTRUCTIONS</p></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Activate the yeast: Briefly stir together the warm water and honey in the bowl of a stand mixer.  Sprinkle the yeast on top of the water and give it a quick stir, then let the mixture rest for 5-10 minutes until the yeast is foamy.</li>
            <img src="yeast.png" width="300px" height="300px">
            <li>Mix the dough: Add the flour, yogurt, salt, baking powder, and egg.  Using the dough attachment, mix the dough on medium-low speed for 2-3 minutes until smooth.  (The dough will still be slightly sticky, but should form into a ball that pulls away from the sides of the mixing bowl.  If it is too sticky, add a bit more flour.)</li>
            <li>Let the dough rise. Remove dough from the mixing bowl and use your hands to shape it into a ball.  Grease the mixing bowl (or a separate bowl) lightly with cooking spray, then place the dough ball back in the bowl and cover it with a damp towel.  Place the bowl in a warm location and let it rise for 1 hour until the dough has nearly doubled in size.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Make the garlic butter: During the last 10 minutes of the doughs rise time, heat the butter in a small sauté pan over medium heat until melted.  Add the garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.  Remove the pan from heat and stir in some chopped herbs, if desired.  (You can also strain out the garlic chunks if you prefer the garlic butter to be completely smooth.)</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough. Once the dough is ready to go, transfer it to a floured work surface and shape it into an even(ish) circle.  Cut the dough into 8 equally-sized wedges and roll each wedge into a ball with your hands.  Then use a rolling pin to roll out the dough ball until it forms an oval about 1/4-inch thick.</li>
            <li>Roll out the next dough ball while you cook one on the stove.
                Cook the dough. Heat a large cast-iron skillet or non-stick sauté pan over medium-high heat until it is nice and hot.  Add a piece of the rolled-out dough to the pan and cook for 1 minute, or until the top of the dough begins to bubble and the bottom turns lightly golden.  Flip the dough and cook on the second side for 30-60 seconds, or until the bottom is golden as well, then transfer the dough to a clean plate.  (If you are making garlic naan, brush one or both side(s) of the dough with the garlic butter once the naan has cooked.)  Sprinkle the naan with a pinch of flaky sea salt, if desired. Then lightly cover the naan with a clean towel so that it stays warm.  Repeat with remaining dough until all of the naan pieces are cooked, adjusting the heat of the pan if needed to keep it hot (but not overly-hot so that it burns the bread).</li>
